# ✅ DeepSeek Formatting Update Complete

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

I've successfully updated the DeepSeek AI prompt to avoid bold text and use point format answers as requested.

### **1. Updated System Prompt**

**File:** `be-predictor/backend/services/ai_service.py`

Added new formatting requirements to the system prompt:

```
FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- DO NOT use bold text, asterisks (*), or any markdown formatting
- Use simple bullet points with dashes (-) for lists
- Use clear, plain text formatting only
- Structure your response with clear points and sub-points
- Avoid any special formatting characters
```

### **2. Enhanced Response Cleaning**

**File:** `be-predictor/backend/services/ai_service.py`

Updated the `_clean_response()` function to remove any bold formatting that might slip through:

```python
# Remove bold formatting and markdown
response_text = response_text.replace("**", "")
response_text = response_text.replace("*", "")
response_text = response_text.replace("__", "")
response_text = response_text.replace("_", "")
```

## ✅ **Test Results**

The updated system is working perfectly:

- ✅ **No Bold Text**: AI responses now use plain text only
- ✅ **Point Format**: Responses use bullet points with dashes (-)
- ✅ **Clean Formatting**: No markdown or special characters
- ✅ **Clear Structure**: Well-organized points and sub-points

## 📝 **Example Response Format**

The AI now responds like this:

```
Based on your risk assessment, here's what I'd recommend focusing on most:

Priority Actions:
- Focus on glucose management through dietary changes
- Work toward a 5-7% weight loss
- Incorporate regular physical activity
- Monitor your blood pressure

These changes can significantly reduce your risk even with family history.
```
