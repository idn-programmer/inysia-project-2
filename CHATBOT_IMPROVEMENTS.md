# Chatbot Improvements - Risk Factor Recommendations

## Changes Made

### 1. Lowered Threshold for Factor Display
**File:** `be-predictor/backend/routers/chat.py` (Line 42)

**Before:**
```python
if abs(contribution) < 0.01:  # Skip negligible contributions
```

**After:**
```python
if abs(contribution) < 0.001:  # Skip negligible contributions
```

**Impact:** Now captures all SHAP values between -0.1 and +0.1, ensuring all meaningful risk factors are shown.

### 2. Added "Immediate Actions You Can Take" Section
**File:** `be-predictor/backend/routers/chat.py` (Lines 153-179)

New section provides specific, actionable steps for top 3 risk factors:

- **Glucose** → Track blood sugar and reduce sugary foods this week
- **BMI** → Begin with 20 minutes of walking daily and portion control
- **Blood Pressure** → Reduce salt intake and start blood pressure monitoring
- **Pulse Rate** → Start cardiovascular exercise like brisk walking or cycling
- **Weight** → Set a goal to lose 5-10% of body weight through diet and exercise
- **Hypertensive** → Work with your doctor to manage blood pressure effectively

If no actions are needed (all factors are favorable):
- Shows: "Continue maintaining your healthy lifestyle habits"
